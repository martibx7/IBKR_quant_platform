### The Core Philosophy: The Market as an Auction

[cite_start]Before learning the strategy, you must understand its foundation: the market is a continuous two-way auction process. [cite_start]Its primary purpose is to facilitate trade by auctioning from high to low to find buyers, and from low to high to find sellers, until it discovers an area of perceived value where trade is most active. [cite_start]Your goal as a trader is to read this auction process to determine the market's intended direction and the strength of that conviction.

[cite_start]This methodology primarily uses the **Market Profile**, a tool that organizes price on the vertical axis against time on the horizontal axis, creating a distribution of where the market has spent the most and least time.

### Part 1: Foundational Concepts (The Building Blocks)

To trade using this strategy, you must first understand and identify the key structural elements of the Market Profile.

* [cite_start]**Time Price Opportunity (TPO):** The basic building block of the Profile. [cite_start]Each half-hour of the trading day is assigned a letter; when a price is traded during that half-hour, that letter (a TPO) is marked on the chart next to the price.
* **Initial Balance (IB):** The price range established during the first hour of trading (the first two TPO letters). It represents the initial activity, often dominated by shorter-term traders ("locals"). Its width can provide early clues about the type of day that may develop.
* [cite_start]**Point of Control (POC):** The price level with the greatest number of TPOs for the session. [cite_start]This is the price where the most time was spent, representing the "fairest price" at which business was conducted during the day.
* **Value Area (VA):** The price range where approximately 70% of the day's trading occurred. This area represents value as accepted by the market participants for that day. Trading within the value area is considered balanced; trading outside of it is not.
* [cite_start]**Tails (or Extremes):** Long, thin sections of the Profile with only single TPOs at the very top or bottom. [cite_start]A "buying tail" at the low indicates strong buyers rejecting lower prices, and a "selling tail" at the high indicates strong sellers rejecting higher prices. [cite_start]These are signs of "excess" and strong directional conviction.
* [cite_start]**Range Extension:** Any price movement beyond the Initial Balance. [cite_start]This is significant because it signifies that longer-term market participants ("other timeframe" participants) have entered the market with enough conviction to move price beyond the initial range.

### Part 2: The Strategic Framework

This strategy involves a multi-step process of preparation, observation, and execution based on how the above structural elements unfold during the trading day.

#### **Step 1: Pre-Market Preparation**

Before the market opens, your goal is to understand the broader context.

1.  **Identify the Broader Market Structure:** Are we in a **bracketed market** (balancing, moving sideways between two reference points)  or a **trending market** (a divergence of price away from value)? Your core strategy will change depending on the answer.
2.  **Note Key Reference Points:** Identify critical price levels from previous sessions:
    * [cite_start]Previous day’s high, low, POC, and Value Area.
    * [cite_start]Any significant long-term tails, gaps, or balance-area extremes.
3.  [cite_start]**Monitor the Opening Call:** The succession of calls before the open provides the first clues to market sentiment and the potential opening price.

#### **Step 2: Analyze The Open (The First 30-60 Minutes)**

[cite_start]The open is a critical gauge of market conviction. How it behaves reveals the underlying strength of buyers and sellers.

* **Relation to Yesterday's Value:**
    * [cite_start]**Open within Value:** Suggests the market is in balance and sentiment hasn't changed much. [cite_start]Risk and opportunity are lower, and the day may be contained within the previous day's range.
    * **Open outside of Value, but within Range:** The market is slightly out of balance. Risk is higher, but so is opportunity.
    * [cite_start]**Open outside of Range (Gap):** The market is clearly out of balance. [cite_start]This presents the greatest risk and opportunity. [cite_start]The market is attempting to establish a new perception of value.
* [cite_start]**Identify the Opening Type:**
    * **Open-Drive:** A strong, directional open fueled by conviction. The market opens and aggressively moves in one direction without returning to the opening range. This often signals a Trend Day.
    * [cite_start]**Open-Test-Drive:** The market opens, tests a key reference point (e.g., prior day's low), fails to find new business, and then reverses and drives in the opposite direction. [cite_start]The tested extreme is often a reliable reference point for the session.
    * **Open-Rejection-Reverse:** Price moves in one direction, stalls, and then is strongly returned through the opening range by the opposing party. This signals lower conviction than a drive.
    * [cite_start]**Open-Auction:** Random, two-sided trading around the open, typically within the prior day's range. [cite_start]It suggests a lack of conviction and a higher probability of a non-trend or balancing day.

#### **Step 3: Day Timeframe Execution**

Your actions during the day are dictated by the context you've established. [cite_start]The core question is always: *Who is in control?*  This is determined by monitoring the evolving structure.

* **In a Trending Market (or an Open-Drive Day):**
    * [cite_start]The goal is to trade *with* the directional move established by the "other timeframe" participant.
    * Trade location is about getting on board early, not waiting for a perfect price. Entering a trade in the direction of a strong trend, even if it feels uncomfortably high or low, is the correct action.
    * Monitor for continuation. [cite_start]A healthy trend will show a series of higher value areas in an uptrend (or lower value areas in a downtrend) and increasing volume.
* **In a Bracketed/Balancing Market (or an Open-Auction/Neutral Day):**
    * [cite_start]The market is fluctuating within a perceived area of balance. [cite_start]The strategy is to act **responsively**.
    * [cite_start]This means buying when price approaches the lower extreme of the defined bracket and selling when it approaches the upper extreme.
    * Trades placed in the middle of the bracket are considered initiative (aggressive) and offer poor risk/reward.
    * Be alert for a **Balance-Area Breakout**. [cite_start]If the market accepts price outside the established bracket (often with a gap or after a failed auction at one extreme), it signals a transition to a trending move. [cite_start]You must be prepared to switch from a responsive to an initiative mindset and go with the breakout.

#### **Step 4: Answering the Two Big Questions**

[cite_start]All of this analysis is designed to help you answer the book's "Two Big Questions," which form the cornerstone of this strategic approach:

1.  [cite_start]***Which way is the market trying to go?***
    * [cite_start]This is your assessment of attempted direction, based on tails, range extension, and auction rotations.
2.  [cite_start]***Is it doing a good job in its attempt to get there?***
    * [cite_start]This is your assessment of directional performance. [cite_start]A market doing a "good job" auctioning higher will be accompanied by higher volume and a higher value area placement. [cite_start]A market trying to go higher on low volume and a lower value area is doing a "poor job," and the move is likely to fail.

### Summary of the Strategy

This is not a passive system but an active process of observation and interpretation. The strategy can be summarized as follows:

1.  **Prepare:** Know the long-term context and key reference levels before the open.
2.  **Observe:** Analyze the open to form a hypothesis about market conviction and the likely day type.
3.  **Execute:**
    * [cite_start]In **balancing markets**, trade responsively from the edges of the bracket.
    * [cite_start]In **trending markets**, trade with the initiative move early.
4.  [cite_start]**Evaluate:** Continuously assess whether the market is succeeding or failing in its attempted direction by monitoring volume and value area migration.
5.  [cite_start]**Be Flexible:** Be ready for the market to transition from balance to trend (and vice-versa) and adapt your strategy accordingly.

[cite_start]Finally, the book stresses that true proficiency comes from combining this market understanding with **self-understanding**—knowing your own psychological tendencies, strengths, and weaknesses as a trader.
