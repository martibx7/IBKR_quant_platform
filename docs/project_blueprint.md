Project Blueprint: Evolving the Quant Platform with ML
Objective: To evolve my existing, rule-based quantitative trading platform into an adaptive system by integrating machine learning techniques. The core principle is to use ML to enhance and improve existing strategies, not to create them from scratch.

Key Components We Designed:

ML as a "Regime Filter" (HMM):

Concept: Implement a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to identify the current market regime (e.g., 'mean-reverting', 'trending', 'high-volatility').
Implementation: Create an HMMRegimeFilter class within a new ml_models directory. This class will handle training, saving, and predicting regimes.
Integration: The BacktestEngine will use this filter to pass the current regime to the active strategy on each bar. The strategy (e.g., MeanReversionVolumeStrategy) will then use the regime as a "gate" to decide if it's allowed to take trades.
Model Selection: Use AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) to statistically determine the optimal number of states for the HMM, avoiding guesswork.
Systematic Parameter Optimization:

Concept: Address the problem of "floundering" with manual parameter tuning by building a systematic optimizer.
Implementation: Create an Optimizer class within a new optimizer directory. This class will wrap the BacktestEngine.
Methodology: Implement a Grid Search that programmatically tests every combination of a predefined set of parameters (e.g., sma_period, deviation_multiplier) and identifies the set that produces the best performance metric (e.g., Sharpe Ratio).
Goal: To use historical data to find the most robust parameters for a given strategy, turning manual tuning into a data-driven science.
Broader Strategy & Future Directions:

Core Philosophy: Acknowledge that most strategies are variations of Mean Reversion or Trend Following/Momentum. The goal is to build these archetypes and use ML to know when to apply them.
Next Steps After Implementation:
Explore Walk-Forward Optimization as a more robust method than a simple Grid Search.
Investigate developing a Statistical Arbitrage (Pairs Trading) strategy, which is a perfect fit for the existing framework and a feasible path for a retail quant.
Develop estimation of Cummulative Volume Delta (CVD) as a feature for ML models, which can provide insights into market sentiment and liquidity.
