Mean Reversion with Volume Confirmation Strategy
1. Strategy Name
Mean Reversion with Volume Confirmation

2. Core Idea
This strategy aims to profit from temporary price deviations from a short-term moving average, combined with strong volume as confirmation of a potential reversal. The core assumption is that prices, after a significant move away from their average, tend to revert back to that average. High volume during the reversal candle indicates conviction behind the move.

3. Entry Logic (Long Position Example)
The strategy looks for opportunities to buy (go long) a stock when it has recently experienced a significant dip and shows signs of reversing upwards with strong volume.

Conditions for Long Entry:

Price Deviation: The current closing price of the stock is significantly below its Simple Moving Average (SMA) over a defined short period.

Specifically, Current Close Price < SMA(N) - (Deviation Multiplier * ATR(M))

SMA(N): N-period Simple Moving Average of the Close Price.

ATR(M): M-period Average True Range, used to normalize the deviation threshold based on volatility.

Deviation Multiplier: A factor to determine how far below the SMA the price must be.

Reversal Candle (Confirmation): The current candlestick formation indicates a potential upward reversal.

Specifically, the current bar's Close Price > Open Price (a green/upward candle).

Volume Confirmation: The volume on the current bar is higher than its average volume over a recent period.

Specifically, Current Volume > SMA(Volume_Period)

SMA(Volume_Period): Simple Moving Average of Volume over Volume_Period.

Execution:

If all conditions are met on the current bar, a BUY order is placed to open a position at the Open Price of the next bar.

4. Exit Logic
Positions are exited under one of three conditions:

Take Profit: The stock's price reverts back to the short-term moving average.

Specifically, Current Close Price >= SMA(N) (the same SMA used for entry).

Stop Loss: A fixed percentage loss from the entry price is reached.

Specifically, Current Close Price <= Entry Price * (1 - Stop Loss Percentage).

Time-Based Exit (End of Day): To avoid holding positions overnight, any open positions are closed near the end of the trading day.

Specifically, if the current time is Exit Time (e.g., 15:50:00) or later.

5. Risk Management
Robust risk management is crucial for this strategy:

Risk per Trade: A small percentage of the total portfolio equity is risked on each individual trade (e.g., 1%).

Maximum Allocation: A maximum percentage of the total equity that can be allocated to a single stock position (e.g., 20%). This prevents over-concentration.

Stop Loss Calculation: The initial stop loss is calculated based on a fixed percentage from the entry price.

6. Strategy Parameters (Configurable in config.yaml)
These parameters allow for easy tuning and optimization of the strategy:

sma_period: Integer, period for the Simple Moving Average (e.g., 20).

atr_period: Integer, period for Average True Range calculation (e.g., 14).

deviation_multiplier: Float, multiplier for ATR to define the price deviation threshold (e.g., 1.5).

volume_sma_period: Integer, period for the Simple Moving Average of Volume (e.g., 50).

risk_per_trade_pct: Float, percentage of total equity to risk per trade (e.g., 0.01 for 1%).

max_allocation_pct: Float, maximum percentage of total equity to allocate to a single position (e.g., 0.20 for 20%).

stop_loss_pct: Float, percentage for stop loss from entry price (e.g., 0.015 for 1.5%).

entry_time: String, time of day to attempt entry (e.g., '09:35:00').

exit_time: String, time of day to exit if no other conditions met (e.g., '15:50:00').

timezone: String, timezone for trading hours (e.g., 'America/New_York').

7. Data Requirements
The strategy requires historical bar data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) at a minute or 5-minute interval for accurate execution. Daily data is used for the candidate scanning phase.
