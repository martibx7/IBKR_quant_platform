Final Strategy: Volume Accumulation with Confirmation
Here is the updated documentation, now including the volume filter.

Strategy Type: Day-Trading.
Core Logic: Identify stocks that have broken out of a multi-day accumulation phase on high volume. We then wait for the price to pull back to the Point of Control (POC) of that phase. An entry is only triggered after the price touches the POC and then shows confirmation of buying interest.
Account Constraints: Compatible with a cash-only account with T+1 settlement.
Phase 1: The Scan (End-of-Day / Pre-Market)
Identify Consolidation: Find stocks that have been in a tight sideways channel for the last 10 trading days.
Confirm High-Volume Breakout:
The closing price of the most recent day must be above the high of the consolidation range.
(New Rule) The trading volume on the breakout day must be at least 1.5 times the average daily volume of the preceding consolidation period.
Calculate Master POC: Calculate the Volume Profile for the entire 10-day consolidation period combined to find the single most dominant POC.
Create Watchlist: Add valid candidates to a watchlist, storing the POC and the low of the consolidation range.
Phase 2 & 3 (Unchanged)
The intraday logic remains the same: wait for the pullback to the POC, wait for the price action confirmation candle, and then enter, manage, and exit the trade according to the previously defined rules.
